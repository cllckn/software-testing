# **Final Project Assignment: Full-Stack Web Application Development with Comprehensive Testing**

## **Objective**

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a secure, testable, and performance-evaluated web 
application using Node.js, PostgreSQL, HTML, and JavaScript. The project emphasizes comprehensive API testing with 
both IntelliJ HTTP Client and automated tools like Jest and SuperTest, complete frontend validation with Cypress, 
and load testing to analyze system behavior under concurrent usage.

## **Project Requirements**

* Develop a web application for the assigned topic (Node.js & PostgreSQL & HTML & JS &HTML)
  * Implement a user authentication system with:
  * User registration and login.
  * JWT-based authentication and authorization.
  * Develop web interfaces for managing data.
* API Testing 
  * HTTP Client Testing
     * Use IntelliJ HTTP client to test API endpoints.
     * Configure environment variables to switch between application instances.
     * Write test cases in HTTP client to verify API responses and validate returned data.
  * Jest & SuperTest API Testing
     * Configure Jest and SuperTest frameworks for automated testing.
     * Write at least 10 test cases, covering the routes in the Node.js application.
     * Generate a test coverage report.
* End-to-End Testing
   * Implement end-to-end (E2E) tests using Cypress to test the frontend.
* Load Testing
   * Use a load testing tool to evaluate system performance.
   * Simulate multiple concurrent users accessing API endpoints.
   * Measure response times and system behavior under high load.
   * Generate a load testing report with key findings.

## **Evaluation**

As part of the evaluation, each student is required to prepare and present the following:

- A **written report** detailing the project
- A **presentation slide deck**
- A **5-minute oral defense** summarizing the work
- A **live demonstration** of the project on a personal laptop using localhost, to be shown to the committee

- Report Guidelines

  The **report** should provide a clear and concise explanation of your study and must include the following sections:

  * Objective: Clearly state the purpose and goals of your project. What problem are you addressing, and what do you aim to achieve?

  * Methodology: Describe the methods, tools, and technologies used in the development of your project.
