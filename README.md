# Software Testing And Quality Assurance

This course provides a practical introduction to software testing. Students will learn the fundamentals of testing, including unit testing with JUnit, end-to-end testing with Cypress, and API testing using IntelliJ HTTP Client. Through hands-on exercises and a final project, students will gain practical experience in writing, executing, and maintaining test cases for software applications. 

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

    Understand the fundamentals of software testing.
    Learn to write and execute unit tests using JUnit.
    Perform end-to-end testing of web applications using Cypress.
    Test REST APIs using IntelliJ HTTP Client.
