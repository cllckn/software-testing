# Software Testing and Quality Assurance

Software testing is the process of evaluating a software system to detect defects and verify that it meets specified 
functional and non-functional requirements. It is essential for ensuring software quality, reliability, and performance 
throughout the development lifecycle.

This course provides a hands-on introduction to software testing concepts and techniques, covering unit testing, 
integration testing, RESTful API testing, end-to-end (E2E) testing, and load and stress testing.
Through practical exercises, they will gain experience in designing, implementing, executing, and analyzing test cases 
using modern testing tools and frameworks.

## Course Objectives

This course aims to:

1. Introduce fundamental concepts, terminology, and principles of software testing.
2. Develop practical skills in unit, integration, acceptance, end-to-end, and performance testing.
3. Apply structured testing methodologies including Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
4. Enable students to test RESTful APIs and database-backed applications.
5. Train students to use modern testing tools and frameworks (e.g., JUnit, Cucumber, Jest, HTTP clients, Cypress, Artillery).
6. Develop the ability to analyze test coverage, performance metrics, and system resource utilization.
7. Cultivate systematic thinking in designing, executing, and documenting software tests.


## Course Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Explain core software testing concepts, terminology, and testing levels.
2. Design and implement unit tests using JUnit, including assertions, parameterized tests, and test suites.
3. Apply the Red–Green–Refactor cycle within a TDD workflow.
4. Develop behavior-oriented test scenarios using BDD principles.
5. Construct and execute integration tests for RESTful APIs with database interaction.
6. Implement automated end-to-end test cases.
7. Measure and interpret test coverage metrics.
8. Design and conduct load and stress tests.
9. Analyze performance results including latency, throughput, and error rate.
10. Produce structured test reports and evaluate testing effectiveness.
