# Software Testing And Quality Assurance

This course provides a practical introduction to software testing. Students will learn the fundamentals of testing, including unit testing with JUnit, end-to-end testing with Cypress, and API testing using IntelliJ HTTP Client. Through hands-on exercises and a final project, students will gain practical experience in writing, executing, and maintaining test cases for software applications.
